SpreeUserGroups
===============

Introduces user groups and calculator to add adjustment for specified user group.

This fork will calculate the advanced_flat_percent price for user groups if they are logged in. 

It will also update the order line item prices for variants already in the cart. Note that this feature depends on the use of devise for authentification.


Installation
============

Add spree_user_groups to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_user_groups'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_user_groups:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_user_groups/factories'
```
